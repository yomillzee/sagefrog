"""What's New — the release notes the team reads in the admin panel.

One list, newest first, rendered at ``/admin/changelog``. It exists because the
portal ships continuously and nobody watches the deploy log: when a page moves,
a control changes shape, or a number starts being computed differently, the
people running client calls need somewhere to find out *before* a client asks
them about it.

Rules that keep this useful rather than a second commit log:

* **Only user-visible change.** If someone using the portal could notice it —
  a new page, a control that behaves differently, a metric that now means
  something else, a fix for something they reported — it belongs here. Refactors,
  dependency bumps, and internal plumbing do not.
* **Write it for the person using the page, not the person who wrote the diff.**
  Name the screen, say what changed and why it is better. No file paths, no
  function names, no PR numbers.
* **Newest first, and never rewrite history.** Ship a correction as a new entry;
  editing a shipped one means someone who already read it never learns.
* **One entry per shipped change**, not one per commit. A feature that took six
  commits is one entry, added when it goes to ``main``.

Adding an entry is a one-item edit to :data:`ENTRIES` — no migration, no
template. ``KINDS`` is the closed set of badges; add to it only if a change
genuinely is not one of new / improved / fixed.
